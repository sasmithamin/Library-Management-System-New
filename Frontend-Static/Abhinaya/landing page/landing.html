    <h4>About Us</h4>
    <p>The Library Management System is a web application that our team of developers, project managers, and business
      analysts are collaborating on to create. Our goal is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform that
      allows library patrons to easily browse and borrow books. The project manager is responsible for overseeing the
      development process and ensuring that the project is on track, while the business analyst is focused on
      understanding user needs and ensuring that the application meets those needs. As developers, our role is to write
      the code that brings the application to life. We work closely with the project manager and business analyst to
      ensure that the application is functional, easy to use, and meets the needs of our users. Our team collaboration
      is key to the success of this project, and we work together to overcome any challenges that arise and ensure that
      the Library Management System is a top-quality product.</p>
